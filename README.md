# My First Project ðŸš€

This is my very first project using Git and GitHub â€” and definitely not the last.  
Iâ€™m starting simple, but with clear steps and full confidence in where Iâ€™m heading.  

## Why this project?
- To build a strong foundation with Git  
- To practice making commits and managing versions  
- To officially mark the start of my developer journey 

## Mindset
Every expert was once a beginner â€” and this is my beginning.  
Iâ€™m not just trying things out, Iâ€™m **building skills that will grow with every project**.  
First commit today, bigger goals tomorrow.
